                  I mean, what is there to say? Honestly probably anything I want since no one will actually read the words on this webpage. But the US is great (in terms of beauty and things to do, it does a lot of things wrong in other ways). I have a goal of visiting every National Park in my lifetime, which is hopefully doable, but I'm going to be like 94 by then.

               So Mexico was the first time I ever left the country at the ripe old age of 15. It was for my parents' friends' wedding and we mostly stayed on a resort the whole time. So there wasn't a lot of Mexican live, laugh, love going on around me, you know?

               This trip was a gauntlet. We took a week and hit as many cities as we could. I'm talking Venice, Florence, Rome, Orto, and Naples in 7 days. I learned you can buy an entire pizza for &euro;2, Venice is only like 2 sq miles big, and there's a difference between real gelato and tourist gelato. Also, got to try squid ink pasta for the first time, which was not bad.

               Also this fact is technically NSFW, but it's historical and really funny, so you're going to get it. In Pompeii, brothel's were all the rage, right? They were so popular, in fact, that the city carved LITERAL DICKS into the streets and buildings that pointed in the direction of the brothel. So you would just follow the dickrection for the best 2-3 minutes of your day. For proof, please see the photo of me attempting to lick this piece of timeless history.

               This was one of my favorite city for vibes. It was very warm toned, which I loved. Weird fact: their airport had 3 languages: Czech, English, and Korean. Go figure. We didn't do a whole lot of activities, but it was very pretty.

               Fun story: so before I left for SK, I didn't have a brick and mortar bank. So I asked my mom if she could transfer some money into Wons (&#8361;) for me at hers, but she, understandably, heard "ones." So she comes back with like $250 all in 1 dollar bills and I got all upset like "mom, do you think South Korea is a strip club??" and my mom was like, "listen, it didn't make sense to me either, but I wasn't going to question it."
